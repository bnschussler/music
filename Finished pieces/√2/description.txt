This is a more classically inspired piece, but I specifically made this one to explore changes in key signature, which is why this piece doesn't really sit on any single key for very long. Originally, I wanted to make this piece when I realized that a diminished 7th chord could resolve to two chords a tritone apart, so one could make a progression which starts on CMaj and resolves from fdim7 to Gâ™­Maj instead of back to C, changing the key by a tritone (hence the name of the piece). I don't actually modulate like that in the piece, but think it turned out pretty well regardless.
