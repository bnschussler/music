This one has been sitting on my computer for a while because I just stopped working on it. Has kind of a floaty feeling at the beginning, hence the name.  I think it sounds pretty good. Also my first piece with a drum I think. (Sorry if the drum notation is bad I have no idea what I'm doing)

I like to think of the first line as having 3 main beats/measure compared to the rest of the song having 4, but I found that changing the bpm was the simplest way to notate that.
